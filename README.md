# IWantYouBack.Worm
This malware is not destructive to your system, but it kinda attempts to delete .com files. Including "win.com" Which is a file, so vital that without it, everything will be lost (need to reinstall windows). It also deletes file extensions: ".com .exe .mp3 .mp4 .html .png" and ".jpg" these file extensions are gonna be replaced with the .vbs file, with the same code.

This type of malware is called "Worm" which spreads the virus everywhere on your pc and infecting it.

This malware could be desructive to your files, and you can't get them back. Unless you have a backup on a flash drive, or another hard drive.
Do not run this file, unless you have a vm or you want your files removed for good.

That's all!
